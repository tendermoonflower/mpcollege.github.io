        Berkeley (2018) where she earned a bachelor’s degree in Political Science, and has been working as a College
        Counselor and Essay Editor ever since. In 2021, she completed her Certificate in College Admissions and Career
        Planning through UC Berkeley Extension. She has worked with a handful of prep companies around the Bay Area and
        Silicon Valley, and is able to share that breadth of experience with her students without the corporate fluff
        (and exorbitant fees). </span>

        consultation to answer any questions you may have about the process and see if we would be a good fit.

        I like to keep things simple by offering a 10 School Package for a flat rate of $5000 - half paid prior to our
        first meeting, and the remainder paid by Dec 1 or upon completion of the last application. (UC applications
        count as one school).

        Students will be able to pick a one hour block each week to meet with me via video- or voice-call, where we will
        brainstorm, write, and revise essays together on GoogleDocs. Outside of this hour block, I’m always available by
        email for minor edits and questions during normal working hours.

        Once students have completed their applications, I’m still available for any scholarship essays, interview prep,
        or letters of continued interest that pop up as their acceptances begin to roll in - free of charge.
