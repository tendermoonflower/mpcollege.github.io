                    in Political Science, and has been working as a College Counselor and Essay Editor ever since. In
                    2021, she completed her Certificate in College Admissions and Career Planning through UC Berkeley
                    Extension. She has worked with a handful of prep companies around the Bay Area and Silicon Valley,
                    and is able to share that breadth of experience with her students without the corporate fluff (and
                    exorbitant fees). </p>

                writing just might. For most prep companies, profit is the bottom line. They run with the first
                idea a student comes up with, provide minor edits for organization or word-choice, and then rinse and
                repeat. This is great for churning out a high volume of essays quickly, but not great for prompting
                the type of reflection that will spark something in a reader. My expereience with these companies is

                            is that students have been taught to hide themselves behind academic analysis and formal writing.
                             Through brainstorming and active listening in a low-stress environment, I invite students to recall 
                            authentic stories that we will develop into engaging essays.</p>

                            statement if they don’t already have a rough draft. Generally, by mid-September, students will 
                            have a strong working draft that we will spend the rest of the month revising for clarity, organization, 
                            and powerful diction.

                        <p class="process-text">Most students will have hit their stride and are ready to hit the ground running on 
                            their school-specific supplemental essays. We focus on any early-application schools the student may be 
                            applying to. Most students are able to complete not only their early schools, but start on their regular 
                            deadline schools as well.</p>

                        <p class="process-text">These tend to be tricky months for most students - school assignments are piling on, 
                            senioritis is creeping in, and the glow of the holidays is imminent. Luckily, because we front-loaded 
                            our brainstorming in the summer, many students find that they are able to complete the rest of their 
                            supplements with very little stress, and even have time to actually enjoy their holiday breaks.</p>
