                    in Political Science, and has been working as a College Counselor and Essay Editor ever since. In
                    2021, she completed her Certificate in College Admissions and Career Planning through UC Berkeley
                    Extension. She has worked with a handful of prep companies around the Bay Area and Silicon Valley,
                    and is able to share that breadth of experience with her students without the corporate fluff (and
                    exorbitant fees). </p>

                <p class="about-text">At the end of the day, an exceptional SAT score or perfect GPA is not 
                enough to make an admissions officer connect with a stranger - but a piece of authentic personal
                writing just might. For most prep companies, profit is the bottom line. They run with the first
                idea a student comes up with, provide minor edits for organization or word-choice, and then rinse and
                repeat. This is great for churning out a high volume of essays quickly, but not great for prompting
                the type of reflection that will spark something in a reader. My expereience with these companies is
                what's encouraged me to take an approach that slows down and prioritizes cultivating a connection
                with my students.</p>

                            is that students have been taught to hide themselves behind academic analysis and formal writing.
                             Through brainstorming and active listening in a low-stress environment, I invite students to recall 
                            authentic stories that we will develop into engaging essays.</p>

                            have a strong working draft that we will spend the rest of the month revising for clarity, organization, 
                            and powerful diction.

                            applying to. Most students are able to complete not only their early schools, but start on their regular

                            our brainstorming in the summer, many students find that they are able to complete the rest of their 
                            supplements with very little stress, and even have time to actually enjoy their holiday breaks.</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-name">Sebastian Charmot</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">Do not underestimate the importance and difficulty of the written portions that go 
                        into the undergraduate or graduate school application process. The writing process is important because it 
                        is the narrative that serves to persuade an institution why you should be admitted. It is also extremely 
                        difficult, because you must use your past experiences to justify why you think you’d be a great fit and why 
                        you think you can succeed at an institution into one cohesive narrative. 
                        
                        Megan has been instrumental in helping with the process outlined above. I have many disparate past experiences 
                        and finding a common thread between them was not an easy task. You want to be able to use your strongest past 
                        experiences but it’s also important for them to build a story together. Megan helped me brainstorm many possible 
                        variations, and tailoring different combinations of stories to align with the criteria that different schools and 
                        programs are looking for. The actual writing process even after having an outline requires many iterations and 
                        sometimes complete revamps. Megan’s expectations were high, and her feedback was conceptual, often requiring 
                        entire sections to be re-written. This is the kind of editor that you want to work with if you are aiming high. 
                        Applying for top schools, everybody is going to have incredible experiences to talk about, so the narrative can 
                        become a distinguishing factor between applicants. </p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text2">After only one meeting with Megan, I knew she would connect with my daughter as a mentor, 
                        advisor and peer. Over the course of the engagement, Megan struck the right balance of encouragement and push to 
                        motivate my daughter to make steady progress on her essays. She communicated with me throughout with status updates 
                        and proactively asked for my help when needed or when my daughter was not immediately responsive to her outreach. 
                        Megan's guidance on my daughter's writing was of course most important and reflected her ability to raise the 
                        quality and creativity of my daughter's essays while working with her inherent style. I'd certainly recommend Megan 
                        for any parents looking for a counselor with the skill to get the most out of their child in what can be a 
                        stressful but important process.</p>

                    <p class="testimonial-text">In the beginning, I struggled to come up with anything authentic in my essays. 
                        Rather than allowing me to write these shallow essays, Megan noticed my internal turmoil, and  chose 
                        to spend hours talking with me about my interests, challenging me to discover myself past my surface. 
                        Quickly, I found my writing to come more seamlessly as I began to unearth my real passions. I decided 
                        to major in Economics after being introduced to the major by Megan. I found that it aligned with my 
                        interests as well as possible future career goals. With Megan’s help, I was able to write my essays 
                        in accordance with who I really was, instead of the person I was trying to make myself come across for 
                        the sake of being more ‘competitive’ to colleges. Not only did Megan help me write my essays, she left 
                        me with a greater understanding of myself, and the pathway towards uncovering more during my next 4 
                        years in college. </p>
